#Cornwell Code test

This is a code challenge for Cornwell using React.js

It shows the location of Godspeed, a denim store in Melbourne, Australia, and displays the most recent 3 images from its Instagram page.

NOTE: Current images are from my personal Instagram due to API permissions limitations
